- demultiplex reads by index Pair
- output one forward fastq file per matching index pair
- output one reverse fastq file per matching index Pair
- two fastq files for non-matching index pairs (if their indexes don't match)
- two more files for one or both index reads are unknown or low Quality
- add the sequence of the index-pair to the header of both reads in all the fastq files for that category
- algorithm needs to report the number of read pairs w/properly matched pairs
- number of index hopping events
- and the number of unknowns

R1 = first biological read
R2 = index that corresponds to R1
R3 = index that corresponds to R4
R4 = second biological read

def rev_comp(DNA_SEQ):
'''this will return your actual index from your reverse complemented index'''
Change A's to T's
Change C's to G's
Change G's to C's
Change T's to A's
return(rev_comp_DNA_SEQ)

def convert_phred(ASCII_SEQ):
'''this will return the phred scores into the ascii equivalents'''
use ord to convert the quality scores into their numerical equivalents
return(CONVERTED_ASCII_SEQ)

def indexed_header(index1, index2):
  '''This will convert your original head for any header you pass it to the header that contains its paired indexes'''
  your old header will have index1 + index2 separated by a hyphen
  index_count = a dictionary that will count the index pairs as the keys and the number of times they appear as the values
    - set the dictionary such that the default will be the index pair and the value will be zeros
      - every time a new index pair is found, it'll be added to the dictionary and the zero will be updated to 1
      - if the key already exists, update the value by 1
      - NOTE: your dictionary should have 24 keys
  return(NEW_HEADER_LINE)

paired_reads = 0
undetermined = 0
swapped = 0

NOTE: IMPORTANT -- YOU SHOULD HAVE 24 PAIRED INDEX FILES (one for each index), AND YOU SHOULD COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THESE PAIRS OCCURRED
read through all four files, pull out the first four lines of each file and store them into corresponding lists:
  R1 = [L1, L2, L3, L4]
  R2 = [L1, L2, L3, L4]
  etc.
  - use <filename>.readline() to pull out each individual line
  - set the lists locally so they are updated every time you get to a new record
  - L1 = header line, L2 = index, L3, = +, L4 = quality score

  for each DNA sequence in R3:
    convert each DNA sequence using rev_comp, resulting in rev_comp_DNA_SEQ

  Add the index from R2 and the index from R3 to the end of the header lines for both R1 and R4:
    store as variable NEW_HEADER_LINE on BOTH R1 and R4, so in total you'll have 2 new header lines (one for R1, one for R4)

  Check to see if the index from R2 and rev_comp_DNA_SEQ of R3 is in the index file:
    if yes:

      CHECK TO SEE IF THE QUALITY SCORES ARE ABOVE THE THRESHOLD:
      for each quality score in the quality score line of R2:
        use convert_phred to get a running sum of all of the quality scores for that read and get the average
          if the average quality score < THRESHOLD:
            place the record with the updated header line into undetermined_<index-pair>
          else:
            pass onto the rest of the conditions below that match the indexes to each other
      for each quality score in L4 of R3:
        use convert_phred to get a running sum of all of the quality scores
          if the average quality score < THRESHOLD:
            place the record with the updated header line into undetermined_<index-pair>
          else:
            pass onto the rest of the conditions below that match the indexes to each other

      CHECK TO SEE IF THE INDEXES MATCH EACH OTHER:
      if the index from R2 == rev_comp_DNA_SEQ index from R3:
        take the record with the new header line and place it into paired_<index-pair>
        update the value in the dictionary
        paired reads +=1 to count the number of paired reads
      elif the index from r2 != rev_comp_DNA_SEQ index from R3:
        take the record with the new header line and place it into swapped_<index-pair>
        update the value in the dictionary
        swapped +=1 1 to count the reads that were swapped indicating index hopping
    else (if L2 does NOT match to index.txt):
      take the record with the new header line and place it into undetermined_<index-pair>
      this will not be added to the dictionary
      undetermined +=1 to count the number of undetermined reads
